# Tools-for-Bioinformatics
Here are some scripts that I usually use to process and analyze data.    
I upload the generality script to github.    
Hope these scripts are helpful to newbies who are not familiar with the code.

### Monte_Carlo_method
Monte Carlo test for the coordinates of PCA and PCoA
### Process_data_from_qiita
1. download data from qiita on remote server
2. split qiita data to different samples

More biological information analysis processes and scripts are integrated in the software. We recommend that you use our software.

##### By the way, Parallel-META which I participated in the development is a comprehensive and full-automatic computational toolkit for rapid data mining among metagenomic datasets.
##### Many commonly used methods of bioinformatics analysis are integrated in the software, it is strongly recommended that you use it.
