## This script helps you to split fasta/fastq data from qiita.
#### When users download sequencing data from qiita, the sequencing data of different samples are distributed in different files.
#### We can use this script to split them and generate a new sequence data file that named by its sample name
#### Usage: python3 split_to_sample_for_qiita.py inputfile_name
#### Notes: Because I often use FASTA files, the fourteenth line is 2. If you use fastq, you can modify it appropriately.
